(submit pull requests to the "develop" branch)

== Usage ==

To display your features via a theme or a custom plugin, please use the following code:

`<?php do_action( 'woothemes_features' ); ?>`

To add arguments to this, please use any of the following arguments, using the syntax provided below:

* 'limit' => 5 (the maximum number of items to display)
* 'orderby' => 'menu_order' (how to order the items - accepts all default WordPress ordering options)
* 'order' => 'DESC' (the order direction)
* 'id' => 0 (display a specific item)
* 'echo' => true (whether to display or return the data - useful with the template tag)
* 'size' => 50 (the pixel dimensions of the image)
* 'per_row' => 3 (when creating rows, how many items display in a single row?)
* 'link_title' => true (link the feature's title to it's permalink)
* 'custom_links_only' => true (link the feature's title only if a custom URL is set)
* 'title' => '' (an optional title)
* 'before' => '&lt;div class="widget widget_woothemes_features"&gt;' (the starting HTML, wrapping the features)
* 'after' => '&lt;/div&gt;' (the ending HTML, wrapping the features)
* 'before_title' => '&lt;h2&gt;' (the starting HTML, wrapping the title)
* 'after_title' => '&lt;/h2&gt;' (the ending HTML, wrapping the title)
* 'category' => 0 (the ID/slug of the category to filter by)

The various options for the "orderby" parameter are:

* 'none'
* 'ID'
* 'author'
* 'title'
* 'date'
* 'modified'
* 'parent'
* 'rand'
* 'comment_count'
* 'menu_order'
* 'meta_value'
* 'meta_value_num'

`<?php do_action( 'woothemes_features', array( 'limit' => 10, 'link_title' => false ) ); ?>`

The same arguments apply to the shortcode which is `[woothemes_features]` and the template tag, which is `<?php woothemes_features(); ?>`.

== Usage Examples ==

Adjusting the limit and image dimension, using the arguments in the three possible methods:

do_action() call:

`<?php do_action( 'woothemes_features', array( 'limit' => 10, 'size' => 100 ) ); ?>`

woothemes_features() template tag:

`<?php woothemes_features( array( 'limit' => 10, 'size' => 100 ) ); ?>`

[woothemes_features] shortcode:

`[woothemes_features limit="10" size="100"]`

We encourage everyone to contribute their ideas, thoughts and code snippets. This can be done by forking the [repository over at GitHub](https://github.com/woocommerce/features/).

= Can I make feature links open in a new window / tab? =

You sure can, just use the following snippet:

`add_filter( 'woothemes_features_disable_external_links', '__return_false' );`
